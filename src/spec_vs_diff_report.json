  "summary": "The diff adds a new AppHeader with a hamburger button + logo, a left-side AppDrawer using an existing Sheet UI component, and integrates both into the main RootLayout in App.tsx while keeping Splash/Onboarding and StoryReader layouts separate. Navigation uses TanStack Router and the drawer closes on item select. However, the actual static logo asset file is not shown as added, so REQ-5 is not fully evidenced.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Use an existing or generated static logo asset for the header logo and reference it as a static file from the frontend (not via the backend), consistent with the PWA manifest icon path conventions used in the project.",
      "reason": "AppHeader references the logo path \"/assets/generated/gtu-logo.dim_512x512.png\", but the diff does not show the image being added under frontend/public (or any public assets directory). Without the file present, the build/runtime may not be able to serve the logo.",
