  "summary": "Diff adds a web manifest and links it from index.html, adds iOS/PWA meta tags and a service worker with registration, and implements an in-app install prompt banner with dismissal persistence. However, the required generated image assets themselves are not shown as added under frontend/public/assets/generated in the diff summary, so the image-asset requirement cannot be verified as implemented.",

      "id": "REQ-25",
      "requirement": "Add required generated image assets under frontend/public/assets/generated with the exact filenames, and ensure the app references them as static files (including cover image references used by frontend/src/lib/covers.ts resolving at runtime).",
      "reason": "The diff shows references to /assets/generated/*.png in the manifest, index.html, and service worker pre-cache list, but does not show the actual image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated. Also, no change is shown for frontend/src/lib/covers.ts to confirm runtime cover references resolve correctly.",
