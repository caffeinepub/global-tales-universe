  "summary": "The diff adds an in-app UI card and helper utilities to display/copy the current app URL, plus a deployment guide stub. However, there is no evidence in the diff summary of an actual ICP redeploy being performed or of providing a new live production URL to the user as part of the build response/output.",

      "requirement": "Redeploy the current application build to the Internet Computer (ICP) so a fresh live version is available again.",

      "reason": "The changes add an in-app 'Live App URL' card that derives the URL from window.location or an env var, but the requirement specifically asks to provide the updated live URL after redeploy in the response to the user. The diff does not include any actual new/active ICP production URL value, nor any mechanism that outputs the redeployed URL to the user as part of the redeploy completion response.",
