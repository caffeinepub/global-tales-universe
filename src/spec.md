# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redeploy the current application build to the Internet Computer (ICP) and share the newly updated live URL.

**Planned changes:**
- Redeploy the existing app build to ICP to produce a fresh live deployment.
- Provide the updated live/production URL to the user in English after deployment completes.

**User-visible outcome:** The app is live again on ICP, and the user receives the new production link to open the redeployed app in a browser.
